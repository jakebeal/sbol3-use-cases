# SBOL3 Use Case Collection

This repository collects descriptions, examples, and code showing how SBOL 3 can be applied to various use cases.

The goal of this repository is to be a "one stop shop" where people can come

## Using the collection

The repository is organized into a set of directories for use cases. 
Each directory should contain:

 - A README file describing the use case, with illustrations and instructions
 - SBOL files storing use case material
 - Code for creating and manipulating SBOL following the use case

## Contributing to the collection

If you want to see new use cases or have trouble with existing use cases, open an issue with your request.

To contribute additional material to this collection, clone the repository, make your contribution in a branch, and set up a pull request to merge your new material in.
